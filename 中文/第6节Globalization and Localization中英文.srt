1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,100
欢迎回到这个关于ASP.NET Core. 的视频系列。
hey welcome back to this video series about ASP.NET Core.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:05,550
我的名字是jeff writs
my name is jeff writs

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:06,510
我是jon galloway
and I'm jon galloway

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,200
john 你知道吗
and john. you know what

5
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:09,840
我们都是美国人
we're both americans

6
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:10,650
而且，
and,

7
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,510
尽管他试图成为加拿大人
although he tried to be a canadian and

8
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,100
我想早点成为加拿大人
I try to be a canadian earlier

9
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:14,820
失败了，
failed,

10
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,820
但是我的英语说得不好
But I barely speak English well

11
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,590
我学习另一种语言
and I learn another language

12
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,290
我知道很多人都知道
and I know a lot of the folks out there

13
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,800
我相信，你不把英语作为第一语言
I'm sure you don't speak English as your first language

14
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:26,550
怎么做？
how do ?

15
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:35,700
我该如何本地化并确保我们的ASP.NET核心web应用程序能够更好地为那些不是美国人，不说英语的人工作。
how do I go about localizing and making sure that our ASP.NET core web applications  work better  for those folks who  aren't american and aren't English.

16
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:41,300
你知道这是一个很好的问题我已经做了一段时间的ASP.NET演示了
You know that's a great question and it's one that   I've been doing ASP.NET presentations for a while

17
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,560
这是我多年来对以前的ASP.NET版本所做的，我从来没有一个好的答案。
and it's one that I've got over the years for previous versions of  ASP.NET and I never had a good answer.

18
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:47,640
人们会说
and people would say like

19
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,500
你好，你在德国。
hello, you're in germany.

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,030
你跟我说的是关于ASP.NET的我的网站在德语中是行不通的，你知道
you're speaking to me about to me about ASP.NET and my sites don't work in German.  you know

21
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,040
我要对它说抱歉。
I'm going to say yeah sorry about that.

22
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:06,100
幸运的是，在ASP.NET core中我们有一个很好的解决方案，他们已经考虑过这个问题，我对全球化和本地化的支持程度感到非常满意
Fortunately with ASP.NET core we've got a good solution for that they've for that they've actually thought through this and I'm really pretty happy with  the level of support for globalization and localization

23
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,620
在全球化文档中
Here in the docs the globalization

24
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:14,700
在ASP.NET核心文档中，本地化有很多信息。
localization in ASP.NET Core doc is  there's a lot of information here.

25
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,700
我喜欢的另一件事是看贡献者的名字。
another thing that I love is just looking at the name of contributors.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,100
例如，nadeam和hisham都不是来自美国的是本地化专家
for instance nadeam and hisham both folks that are not from the us and are   experts in localization

27
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,400
并为这个贡献了代码和文档
and have contributed  code and documentation to this

28
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,100
因此，看到全球社区为我们的全球化本地化工作做出贡献是令人兴奋的
so it's exciting to see the global community contributing to our globalization localization efforts

29
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:35,640
棒极了！
Awesome！

30
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,400
第一期全球化和本地化定义
first term as far as globalization and localization definitions

31
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:48,400
所以全球化是让我的应用能够说多种语言的过程，
so globalization is the process of making my application  able to speak many languages,

32
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:48,810
好的
ok

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,500
本地化是实际上说的步骤
localization is the step of actually saying

34
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,220
很好
great

35
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,500
现在让我们把它作为一种特定的文化或语言，
now let's target it for a specific culture or language,

36
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:57,960
对，
right,

37
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:58,380
好的
ok

38
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:03,960
所以全球化集中到一个受支持的本地化把语言列表中。
So globalization is opening it up and then localization is focusing it to a list of supported languages alright.

39
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:04,380
好吧
all right

40
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:04,680
对的
right

41
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,200
所以这里有很多不同的东西
so there's a lot of different things in here

42
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,220
这里有关于如何使我的内容本地化的信息。
there's information about how to make my content localizable.

43
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,100
你将看到的主要内容是你的代码和Razor
the main things that you're going to see is your code behind and your razor

44
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,300
这是两个主要地方
right those are your two kind of main places

45
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,200
我们来快速浏览一下，
so we'll take a quick look at this,

46
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:26,430
这就像我说的，这是一个很长的文档，本地化你的应用程序有一些复杂性。
this is like I said this is a long document and there are some complexities to localizing your applications.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,900
所以我建议你去找文档来深入研究这个问题。
and so I refer you to the docs to really dig into this.

48
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,600
但就目前而言，我们必须考虑这个问题。
But for the time we have to look at this.

49
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,820
我先给你们看一下。
I'm going to show you first of all.

50
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,550
这是一个本地化示例
here is a localization sample

51
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,400
这是在文档中准备的
this is prepared this is actually in that docs

52
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,900
它通过这个Demo来演示
it goes through and it talk to you through this exact demo here ok.

53
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:46,380
好的
okay

54
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:46,830
所以
so

55
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,960
在这里设置了一些东西，
with some things that are set up here,

56
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,450
首先是我的服务。
first of all in my services.

57
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,600
我现在运行这个应用程序，
so I'm running the app now,

58
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,100
我有一个更小的屏幕
so I've got a smaller screen available

59
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,300
但在我的服务中，我们实际上是配置服务的一部分，
but  in my services we actually as part of configuring services，

60
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:09,500
建立在这一点上的能力是说这里是我支持的本地化的，对吧。
built into that is the ability to say things like here are my Supported Cultures， right.

61
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,370
所以我可以通过，我可以说，
so I can go through and I can say,

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,420
下面是我的应用程序所支持的本地化
here are the supported cultures that my application has

63
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:23,100
这是我全球化后的内容这是我本地化的语言
so this is the  after I've  globalized it this is these are the languages I've localized for

64
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:23,790
好的
ok

65
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:30,100
所以我可以通过设置两个SupportedCultures 我也可以进入并说设置一个DefaultRequestCulture
so I can go through and set both SupportedCultures and I can also go in and say  set a DefaultRequestCulture

66
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,700
因此，如果浏览器不呈现本地化的语言，
So if the browser does not present a culture that doesn't say the local languages,

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,800
这是我可以在这里写的，我可以指定它，甚至所有这些东西，因为它们在代码中。
then this  is  I can go through here and I can  specify that and I could even  for all these things because they're in code.

68
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,500
我可以运行我自己的自定义逻辑，甚至可以访问它的数据库。
I can go through and run my own custom logic may be even hit it database.

69
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:48,390
好的
okay

70
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,100
这就是这一部分。
so that's that part there.

71
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,700
让我们来看看这个应用，
let's take a look at this this app actually,

72
00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:01,600
你会在页脚看到的例子应用程序的语言是英语。
so this is you know this is an example application you'll see down in the footer. it says language is english.

73
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,300
如果我下拉
if I drop this down.

74
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,000
现在我是法国人
now I'm in french right

75
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:12,100
所以这部分是本地化的
and so portions of this have been localized  this is using the  resources

76
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,000
好的，请大家看一看
OK  take a look in a second

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,700
但这表明了他来自哪里
but this is showing kind of where this comes from.

78
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,700
我的法语不太好，但是我们可以
I my french is not so good so I'm you know but we can

79
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,900
我们可以在这个网站上四处看看，我们可以看到这里的一些东西。
we can look around through out the site and we see we can see them some things in here.

80
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,500
举个例子，让我们看看我们是否有一个联系页面
so for instance let's see if we've got a contact page

81
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,600
是的，我们的联系页面是本地化的
and yes our contact pages  is localized right

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,500
所以我们可以看看这些资源是如何建立起来的
so so we can actually take a look at how these resources are set up

83
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,000
当另一件事
when one other thing

84
00:04:38,099 --> 00:04:41,459
实际上，在我们讲这个之前我想指出一点有趣的事情
actually before we jump into that I want to point out just a small funny thing

85
00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:43,169
我想展示一下
I wanted to show this off

86
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:43,649
并且
and

87
00:04:43,829 --> 00:04:47,009
在这里，他们已经在这个小的下拉菜单中使用了英语和法语。
here they've built in this little dropdown for english and french.

88
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:48,659
这是在示例中建立的
that's built into the sample

89
00:04:48,719 --> 00:04:51,629
同样的，这并不是在ASP.NET核心中构建的，这不是一个标准的特性
into the same ，That's not built into ASP.NET Core,that's not a standard feature

90
00:04:51,869 --> 00:04:53,789
所以我没有意识到那是真的。
And so I didn't realize that was there.

91
00:04:53,999 --> 00:04:57,269
幸运的是，我将向你们展示一些你们可以使用的东西。
fortunately for you I'm going to show you something that you can use.

92
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:05,500
这是一个例子，这个扩展我可以进入并改变我的语言，我的文化
so this is an example， this is an extension where I can go in and change  my  language， my culture

93
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:09,500
当我把它发送回浏览器时，我可以在这里
as I'm sending it back to the browser ，so I can actually in here

94
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:12,959
如果我把它设置为法语，你可以在测试应用程序时使用它。
if I set this to french and you can use this as you're testing your applications.

95
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,000
这是个本地化开关
this is a culture switcher

96
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:16,439
对的
right

97
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:18,838
所以你也可以在你的应用中做这个
and so you can go through and do that in your apps as well

98
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:31,500
本地化转换器所做的事情就是让浏览器发送法语内容
So that will what that culture switcher does is it effectively changes the browser to send that header that says accept the french language information

99
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,800
对，没错。
exactly, yeah.

100
00:05:33,298 --> 00:05:36,208
现在让我们看看这些资源是如何配置的。
so now let's look at how those resources are configured.

101
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:44,300
这些实际上是标准的默认方式。NET本地化是使用资源文件。
so these are actually the standard kind of default way that  .NET localization is using resource files.

102
00:05:44,758 --> 00:05:46,288
如果我进入其中一个
so if I go into one of these

103
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,600
这些实际上是.resx文件或XML
these are actually .resx files or XML

104
00:05:51,028 --> 00:05:53,038
但是这里有一个编辑器
but there is an editor thing for this

105
00:05:53,098 --> 00:05:56,788
我可以为visual studio编辑插件，它内置在菜单UI中
that I can editor plugin for visual studio， it's built in to the menu UI

106
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,500
是的，是的
right, yeah

107
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,500
这是一种标准的做法
so that's kind of the standard way to do this

108
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:06,800
这是一个可扩展的系统，可以提供其他的方式
it is an extensible system where I can kind of， I can supply those other ways

109
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,400
但这是一种内置的工具
but this is kind of with the tooling as is built into this

110
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,200
然后看我如何在一个视图中点亮这个。
and then when I look at how I light this up in  a view for instance.

111
00:06:16,438 --> 00:06:17,938
我们使用这个本地化器。
we use this Localizer.

112
00:06:18,298 --> 00:06:20,698
这个本地化的简洁之处就在于它
what's neat about this localized is it

113
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:26,100
它实际上是关键，是我的默认语言
it actually is the key，  is  my default culture.

114
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,800
那么，我想说的是
so what ? what I can say here is

115
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
如果没有指定的内容或者是我的本地文化，我将使用主页
if there's nothing specified or if it's my local culture.  I'm going to use homepage

116
00:06:36,058 --> 00:06:37,828
否则我就把它放进来。
otherwise I'm going to pull it in.

117
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,158
我将用它来查找它应该是什么。
I'm going to use that is the key to look up what it should be.

118
00:06:41,698 --> 00:06:42,328
动态感觉
dynamic sense

119
00:06:42,928 --> 00:06:45,400
如果你在过去使用过本地化
if you've used localization in the past

120
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:45,418
尝试深入并理解，这是令人沮丧的，
it can be frustrating to try and dig through and and am  understand,
如果你在过去使用过本地化
if you've used localization in the past

121
00:06:45,418 --> 00:06:51,400
尝试深入并理解，这是令人沮丧的，
it can be frustrating to try and dig through and and am  understand,

122
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,500
你知道很难读懂本地化的页面
you know it's hard to read localized  pages

123
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,700
因为本地化的页面本身可以是这样的。
because the localized pages themselves can be  that  they can be.

124
00:07:00,537 --> 00:07:01,887
它们可以是一串钥匙
they can be it's a bunch of keys

125
00:07:01,977 --> 00:07:04,077
这是一堆你知道的奇怪的难读的东西。
it's a bunch of you know strange hard read things.

126
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:08,067
举个例子，如果我们看这里如果我们看一下我的联系页面，
so for instance if we look at this now here if we look at my contact page,

127
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:13,900
你会发现这些本地化的字符串会让你的手机本地化，比如本地化支持。
you'll see that these localized strings say things like localize your phone， look  Localizer support.

128
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,300
所以这是很容易读懂的
So it's actually pretty readable right

129
00:07:16,407 --> 00:07:16,827
对吧？
right？

130
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:23,700
如果我想看一下，在我的联系页面上支持的本地化字符串是什么。
and then if I want to look at  well what is the localized string for for instance support on my contact page.

131
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,600
现在我进入联系人
Now I go into contact

132
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:29,247
我可以看到这里的支持
and I can see here support

133
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,700
你知道这就是它从那个方向下拉出来的。
and you know that's what it's pulling in from that one right.

134
00:07:32,817 --> 00:07:33,087
对。
right.

135
00:07:33,267 --> 00:07:35,157
所以它实际上只是显示了那个字符串
so it actually just showing that string there

136
00:07:35,547 --> 00:07:37,287
但它解释了它的来源。
but it's explaining that's where it came from.

137
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:42,500
现在我看到了一个层次结构，它看起来就像是这些资源文件的命名约定。
Now I'm seeing a hierarchy and it looks like like a naming convention for these resource files.

138
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,400
是啊，没错。
yeah Yeah! that's true.

139
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,400
这就是视图被拉进来的方式，
so that's that's how they're being pulled in based on you know exactly here's the views

140
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,000
它实际上映射了views->home
and it actually maps views->home

141
00:07:52,257 --> 00:07:54,987
然后在下面得到了相同的Views ->Home，对。
and then down here we've got the same this is Views -> Home. Right.

142
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,000
如果我在我的home视图中
so if I'm  in my home view

143
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,900
我的主索引视图页面。
my home index view page.

144
00:08:01,167 --> 00:08:01,377
是的
yeah

145
00:08:01,407 --> 00:08:03,200
我指的是本地化的
and I'm referencing the localized

146
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:03,237
我已经指定了主页项
and I've specified the home page  item
我指的是本地化的
and I'm referencing the localized

147
00:08:03,237 --> 00:08:06,000
我已经指定了主页项
and I've specified the home page  item

148
00:08:06,207 --> 00:08:07,437
在索引中。
in the index are there.

149
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:16,100
它会进入视图主页索引资源并寻找相同的主页项
it's going to reach into the views  home  index resource  and look for  that same home page  item

150
00:08:16,167 --> 00:08:17,907
哦，这是在半路上
oh there it is about halfway down

151
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,500
好的。
okay yeah.

152
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,100
这就是index.fr
and so there we are  this is the Index.fr

153
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,800
如果我有其他的，如果我有日本的索引。jaa.resx会更好。
and then if I had others if I had you know japanese index.jaa.resx  It's better.

154
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:30,297
对的
right

155
00:08:30,357 --> 00:08:31,796
你说的是
and you were making the point that

156
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:37,200
它使用我的默认语言作为这些键的索引器
it uses my default language as the indexer for these for these keys over here

157
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,300
这样的话，如果我不是一个说英语的人写这个
that way  if I'm not an english speaker and am writing this

158
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:46,100
也许我是法国人，我在写，我想提供德语翻译之类的东西。
and perhaps I'm french and I'm writing it and I want to provide german translations and whatnot.

159
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:51,500
我可以使用我的母语，作为访问这些语言的关键
I can use my native language, as the keys  to  access these

160
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,500
完全正确！
exactly！ Fanatstic！

161
00:08:52,600 --> 00:09:00,400
这样一来，你的视图就可以被你的本地语言所读取
and so then your view can be readable by you know  whatever your local language  is in that case

162
00:09:00,447 --> 00:09:01,107
完全正确。
exactly.

163
00:09:01,347 --> 00:09:02,457
这真的很方便。
so that's really handy.

164
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,847
所以这是主要的事情当然我们也看到了
so that's kind of the main thing there's also of course we're also seeing

165
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:10,000
像这样，这也是我的控制器。
things like, here is my  for the controller as well.

166
00:09:10,077 --> 00:09:10,407
对的
right

167
00:09:10,677 --> 00:09:13,497
这里我有我的主页控制器的资源
so here I've got resources for my home controller

168
00:09:13,947 --> 00:09:16,287
让我们看一下我的控制器
and let's take a look in my controllers

169
00:09:17,517 --> 00:09:18,207
在上面，
up here,

170
00:09:19,677 --> 00:09:21,147
我们来看看我的主控制器。
and we'll look at my home controller.

171
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,900
我们已经通过了这个IStringLocalizer。
and so we've passed in this IStringLocalizer.

172
00:09:28,017 --> 00:09:28,317
对吧？
right ?

173
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:37,800
然后我们就可以进行注入了，它只是在这里查看数据信息，通常我只是设置一个字符串而不是使用本地化器
and then we're able to its injected and it's just  view data  message here normally I would just set a string instead I use localizer

174
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,100
调用这个服务，我已经注入了这个键。
and calling to that service I've injected and then again  that key.

175
00:09:42,507 --> 00:09:46,437
所以我的控制器代码仍然可以读取我的默认语言
so my controller the code is still readable by me and my default language

176
00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:48,177
我的当地语言，对吗？
might my local language ，right

177
00:09:48,508 --> 00:09:51,328
然后它会在运行时本地化
and then it's actually just going to localizer this at runtime

178
00:09:51,448 --> 00:09:55,768
再一次是本地化的或者知道它在主控制器类内部操作
so once again the localized or knows that its operating inside of the home controller class

179
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:58,708
没错，我们会找到主控制器资源
exactly. we are going to find the home controller resource

180
00:09:58,858 --> 00:09:59,128
请说
yep

181
00:09:59,188 --> 00:10:00,268
注射
to inject from

182
00:10:00,688 --> 00:10:01,258
我明白了，
i got it,

183
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,100
好的，是的
ok ，yeah

184
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:04,138
这就是它的全部内容。
so that's that's really all there is to it.

185
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:11,700
另一个很酷的东西我想给你们看的是resx文件，是微软本地化的东西
One other cool thing I want to show you is resx files ，are kind of a Microsoft localization thing

186
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,300
它对一些人来说很有用，工具就在那里，所有这些
and it works great for some people ，the tooling is all there and all that

187
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:25,100
我已经和一些做了很多本地化的人谈过，Po文件是微软之外的一种标准
I've talked to some people that do a good amount of localization and Po files are kind of standard outside of the microsoft Dev world

188
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,400
好的
ok

189
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,500
PO文件格式非常简单
PO files the format is pretty simple

190
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,800
它也可以很容易地传递给本地化者，他们可以做他们知道的工作
and it can also be easy to pass off to a localizer, they can do the work they know their

191
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,500
PO文件很容易处理，然后他们可以把它传递给你，所以我必须把这些PO文件转换成resx！
PO files it's easy to work with and then they can kind of pass it back to you.   So do I have to convert those PO files to resx!

192
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,500
这是很酷的一件事
now, so that's a cool thing

193
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:50,300
orchard project or Orchard Core，如果我在这里查找，我们去orchardproject.net，我相信，
So the orchard project or Orchard Core, so if I lookup here. Let's go to orchardproject.net I believe,

194
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,800
Orchard NET 提供的CMS，
so Orchard is a .NET powered CMS ok,

195
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:55,200
好的
ok

196
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,229
而orchard core支持PO文件本地化。
and orchard core has support for PO file localization.
好的
ok

197
00:10:55,229 --> 00:10:59,600
而orchard core支持PO文件本地化。
and orchard core has support for PO file localization.

198
00:10:59,819 --> 00:11:01,799
这是在文档中
so this is actually in the docs

199
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:08,600
如果我们去看docs.microsoft.com 的全球化，本地化部分中寻找。
here if we go to you know the  the docs.microsoft.com looking in the looking in the globalization, localization section.

200
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:14,100
他们谈论的是PO文件，并建议使用orchard core
they talk about PO files and recommend using s  are orchard core for that.

201
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,500
这里你看到的是一个示例
so here you're seeing here is a sample profile.

202
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:20,789
它可以更简单，重量更轻，
it can be a lot simpler and lighter weight to use,

203
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:25,800
使用po文件而不是resx文件你知道它有很多xml文件
use a po file as opposed to resx file which  you know has a lot of xml to it

204
00:11:26,789 --> 00:11:28,799
这就是它的标准，
So that's kind of the standard for it,

205
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:40,900
至于它的外观，然后你会看到应用程序内部，这里我们要做的是Services.AddPortableObjectLocalization
for how it looks and then here you'll see inside the application,  so here we're doing Services.AddPortableObjectLocalization

206
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:43,589
这就是点亮的东西
so that's really that lights that up

207
00:11:43,949 --> 00:11:48,509
否则我们就会像之前那样，配置默认的和受支持的本地化，
otherwise we'd just configure those default and supported cultures just like we did before,

208
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:49,400
对的
right

209
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:49,439
这是最后一件事我想给你们展示的是我的PO文件。
so that's and then the final thing I want to show you here is my PO file.
对的
right

210
00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:56,500
这是最后一件事我想给你们展示的是我的PO文件。
so that's and then the final thing I want to show you here is my PO file.

211
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:57,659
好的
ok

212
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:03,900
好了，你们知道，我们讨论了全球化的问题
Okay, so you know to kind of circle way back, we talked about what globalization

213
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:10,500
在国际化的过程中，全球化使你的应用程序本地化
In the process of internationalizing an applicatio globalizing is making your application ready to be localized

214
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,600
本地化是你真正深入的地方，你说我支持以下四种语言
Localization is where you actually drill down ，and you say I support the following four languages

215
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,100
你们知道我是如何打开ie的，这是我写这些字符串的方式，
and you know here's how I turn on the ie here's how I write those strings,

216
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:30,200
我们研究了如何使用定位器，无论是在视图还是在我的代码中
We looked at how you can use the localizer， both in views and in my code

217
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,660
最后我们看了一下从哪里可以得到这些字符串
and then finally we looked at where I can get those strings from

218
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,300
我们可以从resx文件中提取它们
and we can pull them either from a resx file

219
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,100
这在visual studio工具中得到了支持，它是一个xml文件。
and that's supported in the  in the visual studio tooling and it's an xml file.

220
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:47,700
如果你喜欢使用po文件，我们用orchard core支持集，我们展示了一个使用它们的例子，
if you prefer to use po files we looked at how orchard core support set and we showed a sample of using them,

221
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:48,600
太棒了
that's terrific

222
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,940
最后我也会回到这里
so I'll circle back finally too

223
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,830
如果你想深入研究这个问题
if you want to dig deeper into this I

224
00:12:52,900 --> 00:13:00,400
强烈推荐这些文档和示例，这些人是全球本地化和ASP.NETCore的专家
highly recommend the docs on this and the sample file again these people are worldwide experts on localization and ASP.NET  Core

225
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:06,900
他们在ASP.NET Core之前就已经做过了，这些人是你想要学习的人
and they've been doing it before ASP.NET Core with the thing. These are the people you want to learn from

226
00:13:07,021 --> 00:13:07,711
极好的
terrific

227
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,800
这就是我们对全球化和本地化和ASPNET Core的看法。
so that's it that's our look at globalization and localization and  ASPNET Core.

228
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:17,821
感谢您的加入，我们希望您能在我们的视频中看到更多的视频。
thank you for joining us and we hope you watch some more of our videos on aspinet core.

229
00:13:18,271 --> 00:13:18,901
待会儿见。
catch you later.
