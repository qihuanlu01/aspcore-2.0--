00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.200
Hey welcome back to this
video series about ASP.NET core.

1
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:06.600
My name is Jeff Fritz
and I'm John Galloway

2
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:10.000
and John you know what!
both of Americans

3
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:12.366
and although you tried to be a Canadian,

4
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.066
I tried to be a Canadian earlier failed.

5
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.200
But I barely speak English well, yeah.

6
00:00:18.233 --> 00:00:19.666
and I learn another language

7
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:22.233
and I know a lot of the folks out there

8
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:26.100
I'm sure you don't speak
English as your first language

9
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:28.633
how do I go about
localizing and making sure that

10
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.066
our ASP.NET core web applications work

11
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.000
better for those folks
who aren't American and aren't English.

12
00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:38.166
You know that's a
great question and it's one that

13
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.666
I've been doing ASP.NET presentations

14
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.233
for a while and it's one that I've

15
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.033
got over the years for previous

16
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:45.733
versions of ASP.NET and I never had a

17
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:47.466
good answer and people would say like

18
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.333
hello you're in Germany, you're speaking

19
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.666
to me about ASP.NET
and my sites don't work in German.

20
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.733
You know I'm going to say

21
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:56.066
yeah sorry about that.

22
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:58.700
Fortunately with ASP.NET core we've got

23
00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:00.066
a good solution for that they've

24
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:01.766
actually thought through this

25
00:01:02.033 --> 00:01:04.533
and I'm really pretty happy with
the level of support for

26
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:06.233
globalization and localization.

27
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:11.666
Here in the docs, the globalization,
localization in ASP.NET Core doc

28
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.000
is there's a lot information here,

29
00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:18.600
another thing that I love is just
looking at the name of contributors.

30
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:20.700
For instance Nadeem and Hisham

31
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:23.166
both folks that are not from the US

32
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.633
and our experts in localization
and have contributed code

33
00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:29.400
and documentation to this.

34
00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:31.766
So it's exciting to see
the global community

35
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.200
contributing to our
globalization localization efforts.

36
00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:38.166
Awesome! first term as far as

37
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.433
globalization
and localization definitions.

38
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.233
So globalization is the process of
making my application able to

39
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.300
speak many languages ok and then

40
00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:52.133
localization is the step of actually

41
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.733
saying great now let's target it for a

42
00:01:54.766 --> 00:01:58.033
a specific culture or language, right!

43
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.166
ok. So globalization is opening it up

44
00:02:00.233 --> 00:02:02.300
and then localization is focusing it to

45
00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:04.333
a list of supported languages alright.

46
00:02:04.366 --> 00:02:07.233
Right, so there's a lot of
different things in here.

47
00:02:07.266 --> 00:02:08.766
There's information about

48
00:02:09.033 --> 00:02:11.166
how to make my content localizable.

49
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.566
The main things that you're going to see

50
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.500
is your code behind and your razor right

51
00:02:16.566 --> 00:02:18.766
those are your two
kind of main places. OK.

52
00:02:19.033 --> 00:02:20.733
So we'll take a quick look at this

53
00:02:20.766 --> 00:02:23.266
this is like I said
this is a long document

54
00:02:23.333 --> 00:02:24.600
and there are some complexities

55
00:02:24.633 --> 00:02:26.366
to localizing your applications

56
00:02:26.433 --> 00:02:30.533
and so I refer you to the
docs to really dig into this.

57
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.233
But for the time we have to look at

58
00:02:33.266 --> 00:02:35.566
this I'm going to show you first of all

59
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.466
here is a localization sample.

60
00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:41.266
This is prepared, this is
actually in that doc

61
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.100
it goes through and it talk to you

62
00:02:44.166 --> 00:02:46.433
through this exact demo here ok.

63
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.766
So with some things that are set up here,

64
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.500
first of all in my services so I'm

65
00:02:52.533 --> 00:02:55.366
running the app right now so I've got a

66
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.666
smaller screen available. But in my

67
00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.500
services we actually as part of

68
00:02:59.533 --> 00:03:03.600
configuring services built into that is

69
00:03:03.666 --> 00:03:09.600
the ability to say things like here
are my SupportedCultures right.

70
00:03:09.633 --> 00:03:13.033
So I can go through
and I can say here are the

71
00:03:13.066 --> 00:03:15.633
SupportedCultures that my application

72
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.200
has so this is the after I've globalized

73
00:03:20.233 --> 00:03:22.066
it this is these are the languages I've

74
00:03:22.133 --> 00:03:24.600
localized for okay so I can go through

75
00:03:24.666 --> 00:03:28.233
and set both SupportedCultures
and I can also go in and say

76
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.600
set a DefaultRequestCulture okay.

77
00:03:30.633 --> 00:03:34.200
So if the browser does not
present a culture it doesn't

78
00:03:34.233 --> 00:03:37.433
say the local languages then this is

79
00:03:37.466 --> 00:03:39.233
I can go through here and I can specify

80
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.200
that and I could even for all these

81
00:03:41.233 --> 00:03:43.600
things because they're in code I can go

82
00:03:43.633 --> 00:03:45.666
through and run my own custom logic

83
00:03:45.733 --> 00:03:48.333
maybe even hit a database. Hmm okay.

84
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.100
So that's that part there.

85
00:03:51.166 --> 00:03:53.766
Let's take a look at this this app actually,

86
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.166
so this is you know
this is an example application

87
00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.700
you'll see down in the footer it says

88
00:03:59.733 --> 00:04:02.666
language is English and if I drop this

89
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.566
down now I'm in French right and so

90
00:04:06.633 --> 00:04:08.700
portions of this have been localized

91
00:04:08.766 --> 00:04:12.133
this is using the resources.

92
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.400
Ok, take a look in a second but this is

93
00:04:14.433 --> 00:04:16.700
showing kind of where this comes from.

94
00:04:16.766 --> 00:04:19.000
I my French is not so good.

95
00:04:19.066 --> 00:04:21.466
So you know but we can look around

96
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.300
throughout the site and we see we can

97
00:04:23.366 --> 00:04:25.033
see them some things in here.

98
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.300
So for instance let's see if we've got

99
00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:29.766
our contact page and yes our contact

100
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.400
page is localized right. So we can

101
00:04:33.433 --> 00:04:35.266
actually take a look at how these

102
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.766
resources are set up, one other thing

103
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.566
actually Before we jump into that I want

104
00:04:39.633 --> 00:04:41.433
to point out just a small funny thing.

105
00:04:41.466 --> 00:04:44.233
I wanted to show this off and here they've

106
00:04:44.266 --> 00:04:46.033
built in this little drop down for

107
00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.600
English and French right that's built

108
00:04:47.633 --> 00:04:49.400
into the sample. Into the sample.

109
00:04:49.433 --> 00:04:51.466
That's not built into ASP.NET Core,
that's not a standard feature. No!

110
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.566
And so I didn't realize that was there.

111
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.433
Fortunately for you I'm going to show

112
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.200
you something that you can use. So this

113
00:04:58.266 --> 00:05:00.766
is an example, this is an extension where

114
00:05:01.033 --> 00:05:05.466
I can go in and change
my language, my culture

115
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.266
as I'm sending it back to the browser.

116
00:05:07.333 --> 00:05:10.333
So I can actually in here if I set this to

117
00:05:10.366 --> 00:05:11.533
French you can use this as

118
00:05:11.566 --> 00:05:13.533
your testing your applications this is a

119
00:05:13.566 --> 00:05:17.033
a culture switcher right and so you can

120
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.033
go through and do that
in your apps as well.

121
00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.733
So that will what that culture

122
00:05:22.766 --> 00:05:25.633
switcher does is it effectively changes

123
00:05:25.666 --> 00:05:28.200
the browser to send that header that

124
00:05:28.233 --> 00:05:30.166
says accept the french language

125
00:05:30.233 --> 00:05:33.700
information. Exactly! yep, so now let's

126
00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:36.200
look at how those
resources are configured.

127
00:05:36.266 --> 00:05:38.066
So these are actually the

128
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.200
standard kind of default way that

129
00:05:40.233 --> 00:05:43.300
.NET does localization is using

130
00:05:43.333 --> 00:05:45.766
resource files. So if I go into one of

131
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.533
these there's a these
are actually .resx files or XML

132
00:05:50.566 --> 00:05:52.033
but there is an editor

133
00:05:52.066 --> 00:05:54.200
thing for this that I can editor plugin

134
00:05:54.233 --> 00:05:56.366
for Visual Studio it's built into the UI

135
00:05:56.433 --> 00:05:59.066
right. Yep! so that's kind of the standard

136
00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.000
way to do this. It is an extensible

137
00:06:02.066 --> 00:06:06.000
system where I can kind of I can supply

138
00:06:06.066 --> 00:06:07.366
those other ways but this is kind of

139
00:06:07.433 --> 00:06:09.233
what the tooling is built in for this

140
00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.600
and then when I look at how I light this

141
00:06:11.633 --> 00:06:18.000
up in a view for instance,
we use this Localizer.

142
00:06:18.066 --> 00:06:24.133
What's neat about this
Localizer is it actually is the key is

143
00:06:24.166 --> 00:06:28.133
my DefaultCulture. So what I can

144
00:06:28.166 --> 00:06:31.266
say here is if there's nothing

145
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.500
specified or if it's my local culture

146
00:06:33.566 --> 00:06:36.766
I'm going to use homepage otherwise I'm

147
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.766
going to pull it in I'm going to use

148
00:06:39.033 --> 00:06:42.000
that is the key to look up
what it should be. Alright!

149
00:06:42.033 --> 00:06:43.266
That makes sense, if you've

150
00:06:43.333 --> 00:06:45.700
used localization in the past it can be

151
00:06:45.733 --> 00:06:48.766
frustrating to try and dig through

152
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.166
and understand you know it's hard to

153
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.233
read localized pages. Because the

154
00:06:56.266 --> 00:06:59.066
localized pages themselves can be they

155
00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.333
can be it's a bunch of keys, it's a bunch

156
00:07:02.366 --> 00:07:04.033
of you know strange hard to read things

157
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:06.033
so for instance if we look at this now

158
00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:07.600
here if we look at my contact page

159
00:07:07.633 --> 00:07:10.533
you'll see that these localized strings

160
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.566
say things like Localizer phone, look

161
00:07:12.633 --> 00:07:17.033
Localizer support. So it's actually
pretty readable right

162
00:07:17.066 --> 00:07:19.666
and then if I want to look at well what is

163
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.633
the localized string for instance

164
00:07:21.666 --> 00:07:25.266
support on my contact page. Now I go into

165
00:07:25.333 --> 00:07:28.766
contact and I can see here support

166
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.200
and you know that's what it's
pulling in from that one right.

167
00:07:33.233 --> 00:07:35.266
So it's actually just
showing that string there

168
00:07:35.333 --> 00:07:37.333
but it's explaining that's
where it came from.

169
00:07:37.366 --> 00:07:39.766
Now I'm seeing a hierarchy and it looks

170
00:07:40.033 --> 00:07:42.466
like a naming convention
for these resource files.

171
00:07:42.533 --> 00:07:44.600
Yeah! that's true.

172
00:07:44.633 --> 00:07:46.333
So that's how they're being pulled

173
00:07:46.366 --> 00:07:48.700
in based on you know exactly here's the

174
00:07:48.733 --> 00:07:51.633
views and it actually maps Views -> Home

175
00:07:51.666 --> 00:07:53.666
and then down here we've got the same

176
00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.433
this is Views -> Home. Right.

177
00:07:55.466 --> 00:08:01.100
So if i'm in my Home view,
my home index view page

178
00:08:01.133 --> 00:08:03.266
yeah and i'm referencing the localizer

179
00:08:03.333 --> 00:08:06.033
and i've specified the home page item

180
00:08:06.066 --> 00:08:08.666
in the index were there,
it's going to reach

181
00:08:08.733 --> 00:08:12.533
into the views -> home -> index resource

182
00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.100
and look for that same home page item.

183
00:08:16.133 --> 00:08:18.200
Oh there it is but halfway down

184
00:08:18.266 --> 00:08:22.366
okay yep and so there we are this is the

185
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:26.333
Index.fr and then if i had others if

186
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.133
I had you know
Japanese index.jaa.resx. It's better.

187
00:08:29.166 --> 00:08:31.666
Okay and you were making the point that

188
00:08:31.733 --> 00:08:33.500
it uses my default language

189
00:08:33.566 --> 00:08:36.733
as the Index for these keys

190
00:08:36.766 --> 00:08:39.466
over here, that way if I'm not an

191
00:08:39.533 --> 00:08:41.333
English speaker and I'm writing this

192
00:08:41.366 --> 00:08:43.500
and perhaps, I'm French and I'm writing it

193
00:08:43.533 --> 00:08:45.400
and I want to preferred
German translations

194
00:08:45.466 --> 00:08:48.600
and whatnot, I can use my native language

195
00:08:48.633 --> 00:08:52.666
as the keys to access
these. Exactly! Fanatstic!

196
00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.200
and so then your view can be readable

197
00:08:55.266 --> 00:08:57.533
by you know whatever your

198
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:02.433
local language is in that case exactly!
Okay, so that's really handy.

199
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.666
So that's kind of the mainthing

200
00:09:03.733 --> 00:09:05.766
there's also of course, we're also seeing

201
00:09:06.033 --> 00:09:09.400
things like here is my
for the controller

202
00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:12.133
as well, right. So here I've got resources

203
00:09:12.166 --> 00:09:18.200
for my HomeController and let's take
a look in my controllers up here

204
00:09:18.233 --> 00:09:23.166
and we'll look in my HomeController

205
00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.233
and so we've passed in
this IStringLocalizer.

206
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.400
Right and then we're able to

207
00:09:29.433 --> 00:09:31.766
it's injected and it's just

208
00:09:32.033 --> 00:09:34.733
ViewData message here normally I would

209
00:09:34.766 --> 00:09:38.066
just set a string
instead I use localizer

210
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.766
and calling to that service

211
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.133
I've injected and then again that key.

212
00:09:42.166 --> 00:09:44.200
So my controller the code is still

213
00:09:44.266 --> 00:09:46.233
readable by me and my default language

214
00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:49.166
in my local language right and then it's

215
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.233
actually just going to
localizer this at runtime.

216
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:53.133
So once again the localizer knows

217
00:09:53.166 --> 00:09:55.566
that it's operating inside of
the HomeController class

218
00:09:55.633 --> 00:09:59.133
exactly! We're going to find
the HomeController resource yep,

219
00:09:59.166 --> 00:10:02.166
to inject from yeah I got it okay yeah.

220
00:10:02.233 --> 00:10:04.233
So that's really all there is to it.

221
00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.566
One other cool thing
I want to show you is

222
00:10:06.633 --> 00:10:11.166
resx files are kind of a
Microsoft localization thing

223
00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:15.033
and it works great for
some people, the tooling

224
00:10:15.066 --> 00:10:18.100
is all there and all that. I've talked

225
00:10:18.133 --> 00:10:19.566
to some people that do a good amount of

226
00:10:19.633 --> 00:10:22.766
localization and PO files are kind of

227
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.700
standard outside of the
Microsoft Dev world. Ok.

228
00:10:25.733 --> 00:10:28.566
PO files the format is pretty simple

229
00:10:28.633 --> 00:10:31.566
and it can also be easy to
pass off to a localizer,

230
00:10:31.633 --> 00:10:34.200
they can do the work they
know their PO files it's

231
00:10:34.266 --> 00:10:36.566
easy to work with and then they
can kind of pass it back to you.

232
00:10:36.633 --> 00:10:39.400
So do I have to convert
those PO files to resx!

233
00:10:39.433 --> 00:10:42.333
No! so that's a cool thing.

234
00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.666
So the orchard project or
Orchard Core, so if I lookup here.

235
00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:50.433
Let's go to
orchardproject.net I believe,

236
00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:55.133
so Orchard is a .NET powered CMS ok,

237
00:10:55.166 --> 00:10:58.766
and orchard core
has support for PO file

238
00:10:59.033 --> 00:11:00.600
localization. So this is actually

239
00:11:00.666 --> 00:11:03.466
in the docs here if we go to you know the

240
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.333
docs.microsoft.com,looking in the

241
00:11:06.366 --> 00:11:08.633
globalization, localization section.

242
00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.766
They talk about PO files and recommend

243
00:11:12.033 --> 00:11:14.166
using as Orchard core for that.

244
00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.633
So here, you're seeing
here is a sample PO file

245
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:19.266
it can be a lot simpler

246
00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:21.666
and lighter weight to use a PO file

247
00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:24.533
I supposed to a resx file which you know

248
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.600
has a lot of XML to it right.

249
00:11:26.633 --> 00:11:28.666
So that's kind of the standard for it,

250
00:11:28.733 --> 00:11:32.366
for how it looks and then here

251
00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:37.166
you'll see inside the application,
so here we are doing

252
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.666
services.AddPortableObjectLocalization.

253
00:11:40.733 --> 00:11:43.533
So that's really that lights that up,

254
00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.600
otherwise we just configure those

255
00:11:45.666 --> 00:11:47.600
default and SupportedCultures
just like

256
00:11:47.666 --> 00:11:50.733
we did before. Right, so that's

257
00:11:50.766 --> 00:11:56.633
and then the final thing
I want to show you here is my PO file.

258
00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:00.133
Okay, so you know to kind of circle way

259
00:12:00.166 --> 00:12:02.600
back, we talked about
what globalization

260
00:12:02.666 --> 00:12:04.766
and localization are. In the process of

261
00:12:05.033 --> 00:12:06.700
internationalizing an application

262
00:12:06.733 --> 00:12:09.166
globalizing is making
your application

263
00:12:09.233 --> 00:12:11.666
ready to be localized. Localization is

264
00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:13.133
where you actually drill down and you

265
00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.033
say I support the following four

266
00:12:15.066 --> 00:12:18.100
languages and you know here's how I turn

267
00:12:18.166 --> 00:12:20.466
on the here's how I write those strings.

268
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.733
We looked at how you can use the

269
00:12:22.766 --> 00:12:25.500
localizer both in views and in my code

270
00:12:25.566 --> 00:12:29.000
and my controllers
or code-behind using

271
00:12:29.066 --> 00:12:31.200
that localizer service
and then finally,

272
00:12:31.233 --> 00:12:32.700
we looked at where I can get those

273
00:12:32.733 --> 00:12:35.066
strings from and
we can pull them either

274
00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.633
from a resx file and that's supported

275
00:12:37.666 --> 00:12:41.100
in the Visual Studio tooling
and it's an XML file

276
00:12:41.133 --> 00:12:43.000
if you prefer to use PO files

277
00:12:43.066 --> 00:12:44.733
we looked at how Orchard Core

278
00:12:44.766 --> 00:12:47.200
supports that and we showed a sample of

279
00:12:47.233 --> 00:12:48.533
using that. That's terrific!

280
00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.200
So I'll circle back finally to if you

281
00:12:51.233 --> 00:12:53.433
want to dig deeper into this I highly

282
00:12:53.466 --> 00:12:55.033
recommend the docs on this and the

283
00:12:55.066 --> 00:12:58.366
sample file again these people
are worldwide experts on

284
00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:02.266
on localization and ASP.NET
and they've been doing it

285
00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:06.066
before ASP.NET Core with the thing.
These are the people you want to

286
00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:10.200
learn from, terrific! Yeah so that's it,

287
00:13:10.233 --> 00:13:14.066
that's our look at Globalization
and Localization in ASP.NET Core.

288
00:13:14.133 --> 00:13:15.166
Thank you for joining us

289
00:13:15.233 --> 00:13:16.266
and we hope you watch some more of

290
00:13:16.333 --> 00:13:17.566
our videos on ASP NET Core.

291
00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.566
Catch you later.
