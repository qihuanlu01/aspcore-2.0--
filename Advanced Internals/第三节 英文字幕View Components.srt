00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,580
Hey there, Welcome back to this

1
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:04,570
ASP.NET Core videos series,

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,730
My name is Jeff Fritz, I'm Jon Galloway.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,870
And you know what Jon, we've spent
lot of time writing code,

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,420
writing some HTML in to Razor templates,

5
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,270
or Razor pages,
and that's lot of code that I've to write.

6
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:18,440
What if I want to do, re-use some of that?

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,160
Yeah, you know, let me tell you

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,510
recently I ran into this,
where I was working on

9
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,960
the .NET foundation website. Oh! OK.

10
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,760
And Index field for home page,

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,600
there's a lot information in there.
There's all kinds of stuff

12
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,400
and some parts of it are things
like a little News view.

13
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,160
You know, a little list of recent blogs posts.

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,020
And there's some frustrating things

15
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,220
with this. One is, My view is huge.

16
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,330
Times are I'm scrolling, scrolling

17
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,220
scrolling to get to it. I don't like that.

18
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,470
Another prob-- and I can break it
apart with partials,

19
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,930
but it just kind of moves a problem,

20
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,930
It doesn't really fix things.

21
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,130
Another thing is, I want to componentize,

22
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,240
so I can reuse like you said
and I also don't want my controllers

23
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:01,290
or my page code-behinds to have to return

24
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,570
really complex models

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,570
I've all kind of-- here is my list in the

26
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,860
here is my list of bloggers, here is my--
and then if I want to

27
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,860
implement it somewhere else on this site.

28
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,890
It kind of do that all over again. Yes.

29
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,440
That's difficult. Yeah--
Ok, so what's the solution for that?

30
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,030
Well, so we talked about this
and I thought it was find kind of

31
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,030
running through the list with a--
you know, we're talking about

32
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,130
like well we could do, partial as we could do--

33
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,100
you know back we-- there is a child actions

34
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,570
which are available
on child actions work for--

35
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,390
MVC and with a child action you can

36
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,220
put inside a controller
you can say, this is just

37
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,810
you know for a partial view
that's going to be return by

38
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:39,920
this controller.
But the problem there it's still

39
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,000
tied directly to controller.

40
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,720
Right. And then you mention tag helpers,
and tag helpers is a

41
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:48,760
is a nice solution, I can-- a tag helper can

42
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,120
I can create a nice little markup
and I can say, write this thing out.

43
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,860
The problem kind of a--
the tag helper is I loose a Razor formatting.

44
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:01,440
Okay, get to wait all your code,
all your formatting in C#. Yeah.

45
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,290
A tag helper is written in C#,

46
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,880
and so I am formatting strings into HTML.

47
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,540
That's not beautiful! No.

48
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,840
So the solution here is view component.

49
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:16,000
OK. A view component is really cool,
because it allows me to

50
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,540
make a small little component.
It's stand alone.

51
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:22,250
It doesn't do the whole model binding
kind of thing that I would use in.

52
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,000
in pages or MVC.

53
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,940
But it is something
I can just drop into any view

54
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:31,480
it works all by itself and the nice thing
with it is, there's a simple class

55
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,000
and it has all the thing, all dependency
injection has all my services available.

56
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,640
And then it's all got an
associated razor template.

57
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:42,420
Very cool! So I get the
benefits of working in razor?

58
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:47,870
I get you know, nice I can write
nice component, nice code in a class.

59
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,170
Yep, drop it in where ever.
Cool! Lets take a look. Yeah!

60
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,970
So here let me show an example

61
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,460
This is actually the page
I was talking about,

62
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,460
so this is an example homepage.

63
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,350
I think of your home page your website
right, there is a tons of different stuff.

64
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,280
And just I am scrolling through
here is the list of news on the left,

65
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,130
list of the events on the right.
So there's-- there some dropping things

66
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,420
If I look down at the bottom here
again, I have got a list of recent posts.

67
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,170
These are things that you know,

68
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,370
you may consider some other things like

69
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,440
and on the doc's which
are pretty good for this here.

70
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:22,280
They list some things like you may
have something like a Tag cloud

71
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,280
or Shopping cart something where you know,

72
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,150
you want to drop it into
a page and it's not just

73
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,370
if its just a chunk of mark up
I would use just a PowerShell.

74
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,020
Sure, but if it's something
where if you've actually got some--

75
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,910
something to populate here like
a Shopping cart list,

76
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,800
I really do think to make since to have
you know some code behind for it.

77
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:44,110
You-- you need that
server side code to interact.

78
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,430
Exactly-- Exactly! OK. So, what I'm
going to be talking through here I--

79
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,510
I refer you to the doc's if you
go to view components

80
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,100
is information about what a
view component is and it talk's you through

81
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,260
building a view component
and there is actually a

82
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,340
whole walkthrough down at the end,
Creating a simple view component.

83
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,640
So, I've actually got that running

84
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,460
quickly and let's take a look at

85
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:09,220
what the code-- you know, how that code looks.

86
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,840
So here we've got actually

87
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:15,060
here's this is a standard view,
down at the bottom,

88
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,600
we've got this await InvokeAsync

89
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:22,350
and it's a priority list, it says
Component InvokeAsync.

90
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,400
So, it's pulling in this view Component
that way.

91
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:28,260
If we look at how that view Component is

92
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:32,400
defined, we've here-- it's a

93
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,970
passed in here from view Component,

94
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,860
and then it just has a-- here's it's got a

95
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,020
GetItemsAsync. So, really that's-- there's

96
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:44,510
not a lot of coder here. What's nice is,

97
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:48,020
a table too, it can use Dependency injections

98
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,110
here, they're using a

99
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,440
data context, OK, I'm just injecting it there,

100
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:57,840
you can also inject other services etc.

101
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:02,020
Sure, And so all this is
doing is returning a list.

102
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:07,120
So this is async so it's  returning
a list of to do items as a task.

103
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:11,870
Then in the view for that
its just binding to it

104
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,530
so this is a very simple binding
here we got an IEnumerable

105
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,730
and we are just binding
to that a IEnumerable list.

106
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,810
And there is some convention to this

107
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,230
this is called default.cshtml.

108
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:28,310
And the kind of naming convention
here is you have components

109
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,450
priority list is the its a priority list

110
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:34,140
few component
and then its called Default.cshtml.

111
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:37,660
So this is very similar to have
we have to views folder above

112
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:43,430
Exactly and this is the views for
a component being hosted inside of

113
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,360
a to do control.
Yes and this sample shows multiple

114
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:50,120
four ways of hosting, so there actually
some different names on this

115
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,120
Oh but this one also is

116
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,590
the standard would be default cshtml
and you can put that either in shared

117
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,150
or in the view specific one

118
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,570
in the controller specific one ,
controller specific exactly.

119
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,000
So this way I can use

120
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:07,000
the same component change the

121
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:11,000
mark up slightly based on
my different controllers needs.

122
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,000
Exactly, so I could have a shared one that's

123
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,000
the standard one and then within

124
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,000
other controllers I can go and mark that up

125
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,000
a bit. Terrific. So this really

126
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,000
is pretty straight forward, now because

127
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,000
this is not depending on anything
else, in-order to display

128
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,000
I drop it into any razor view.

129
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,000
So the kind of simple way to inject this,

130
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,000
simple meaning the default

131
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:36,000
standard way is, I'm doing
Component.InvokeAsync

132
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,000
and then since I don't have model binding

133
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm actually passing in parameters here.

134
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,000
Sure. So, I'm saying this is you know

135
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,000
the priority to take and this is whether

136
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,000
show if they are done or not. Okay.

137
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,000
Because this is for a To-Do-List.

138
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,000
This is okay, but I actually prefer

139
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,000
to share this using a Taghelper,

140
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:57,000
this is pretty slick, because
Taghelpers clean-up our gray razor-

141
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,200
mark-up. They do, right. Here
they've actually got

142
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:06,040
If I do vc: it automatically-- like

143
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,040
view components just automatically

144
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:14,260
become Taghelpers. OK, so it's
just built-in so, just by creating

145
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,710
priority-list, vc priority list
automatically works and on my

146
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,150
properties here also
automatically bound for me.

147
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,220
So we are getting the hyphen's between

148
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,220
the names of our attributes
and the name of

149
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,220
our Taghelper because that's where the

150
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,950
boundary is between the
capitalized word in the name. Exactly.

151
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,950
Yeah, so it does that conversion for me.

152
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:37,710
So that's pretty cool,
let me show you an example then

153
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:41,680
kind of to run back to
how I uses this in mine, so

154
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,710
I had some mark up for to like this,
this is just kind of

155
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,820
staging mark up, right, but so

156
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,820
why I am showing this news items

157
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,220
and this is, it's using boot strap, I'm

158
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,220
using Holder.js to
share different kind of

159
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,150
mark-up like thumbnail for them you know
so with bootstrap

160
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,630
I've got media-heading, media-body

161
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,080
pull-left all that kind of stuff. Oh yeah!

162
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,160
So I would now want to generate this

163
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,260
all in C# but, there is actually some of

164
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,480
reasonable manual code.

165
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,350
There is pulling,
this is actually pulling

166
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,350
it from IIS feeds and stuff.

167
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,320
So here I've got a NewsFeedService

168
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:22,320
and my NewsFeedService is it's-- it's

169
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,090
running this kind of background task,

170
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,160
it's actually using a Syndication.

171
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,160
These Syndication feed
which just was made

172
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,160
available in-- in .NET standard

173
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,160
too recently which is very cool.

174
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,660
So it's kind of running this

175
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:36,560
and this is a service that I've got.

176
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:39,680
So then I've-- I've got in my component,

177
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:43,680
I'm able to inject that.
So I inject my service

178
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:47,550
you know, using constructive injection
so I said that

179
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:51,210
newsService there and then
I just call my InvokeAsync.

180
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,130
This one is simpler than that
other one that you

181
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,130
todo list we are showing,
it's not hitting

182
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,070
your database or whatever the services

183
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,720
doing the-- the hard work here.

184
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,770
So which just you know, you know
getting the feed, the feed is cash

185
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,770
behind the scenes and the service

186
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:07,320
and it's grabbing a quantity
and that quantity

187
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:12,920
is been passed in here
actually it's an input parameter.

188
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:16,970
Exactly! so I can say this is how
many news items I want to show.

189
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,800
And then I can go over

190
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,630
and here is my actual
this is how I converted it into razor.

191
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,750
So I just binding
to IEnumerable news items

192
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:31,120
and then I'm just using my standard razor

193
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:36,400
you know I'm doing the few things
items can take just like for instance

194
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,370
there is multiple URIs
associated with the newsfeed,

195
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:42,750
because there is also an RSS feed
for comments and stuff like that.

196
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,750
So I'm garbing the first and then here

197
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,150
on the description I'm taking
the first 50 characters.

198
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:51,770
Right, so basically that's all that
involved in setting that up.

199
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,650
So,this is the razor template

200
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:58,950
that your component is
view is rendering with. Exactly!

201
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:02,960
ok and so then that
just to kind of show whether

202
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:08,100
that goes that is in, let me see
NewsView right there,

203
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,270
it's a Default.cshtml, ok.

204
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,410
So that's it.

205
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,640
So really pretty straight forward,

206
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:18,800
it solves a problem that
when you run into it.

207
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,070
Yes I mean, I wish I can packages up.
I don't want to have to

208
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:25,890
if you find yourself
from a page or controller

209
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,850
returning a very complex model

210
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:31,220
that has here is a list of these
and here is list of those and all that.

211
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,100
That's kind of sign that you may
want to move that into a component

212
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,700
and then if you got re-usable code
that you just want to reuse to your side.

213
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,800
Yeah! So this is in really a construct,

214
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,320
this is in the view structure
like Tag Helpers

215
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:49,310
they would want to bundle up
into a NuGet package and deploy

216
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,780
Because of I got that razor template

217
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,620
that I need to deploy
appropriately inside my application.

218
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,380
Exactly, Yeah I think this is something

219
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,270
where it's more kind of
application specific,

220
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,870
there may be some you know

221
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,820
super black belt layer
doing some kind of path

222
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,170
provided bla-bla-bla to inject that

223
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,130
I think the standard case is just

224
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:09,320
go through cleanup my markup and take

225
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,320
common things I'm going
to use though my site,

226
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,150
put the razor template there,

227
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:17,150
put my one class,
right my one simple class

228
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:20,320
and then just reuse from
my site then. Terrific!

229
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,880
Alright, so that's about it.

230
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,410
Thank you for joining us

231
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:28,800
and we hope you join us
for the next video on ASP.NET Core.
